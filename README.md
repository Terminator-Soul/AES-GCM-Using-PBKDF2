AES-GCM Encrypt/Decrypt Web App (JS + PBKDF2)
A simple and secure web application that performs AES-GCM encryption and decryption entirely in the browser using JavaScript. It uses PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) to derive strong cryptographic keys from user passwords, ensuring secure encryption.

üîê Key Features:

    Client-side AES-GCM encryption & decryption

    Password-based key generation with PBKDF2

    Secure random IV and salt generation

    Easy-to-use UI with real-time encryption and decryption

    Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
